              <b>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</b> is a Japanese anime
              television series adapted from the original Fullmetal Alchemist
              manga series by Hiromu Arakawa. Produced by Bones, the series is
              directed by Yasuhiro Irie, written by Hiroshi Ōnogi and composed
              by Akira Senju. The series was conceived in order to create a
              faithful adaptation that directly follows the entire storyline of
              the original manga, after 2003's Fullmetal Alchemist anime series
              strayed away from it to tell its own story after running out of
              published manga material to adapt. Production for Fullmetal
              Alchemist: Brotherhood began in 2008. The series was broadcast for
              sixty-four episodes on MBS–TBS from April 2009 to July 2010. The
              series was first licensed in North America by Funimation and was
              broadcast English-dubbed on Adult Swim from February 2010 to
              September 2011. In 2016, Funimation lost the rights to the series
              and it was transferred to Aniplex of America. Fullmetal Alchemist:
              Brotherhood earned acclaim from critics and audiences, and is
              considered to be one of the best anime series of all time.
              Reviewers noted its faithfulness to the manga and its introduction
              of characters and plot details that were not present in the 2003
              anime; the climactic episodes were also lauded for both its action
              scenes and moral messages.

              <b>Steins;Gate</b> is a Japanese anime television series created
              by the animation studio White Fox based on 5pb. and Nitroplus's
              2009 visual novel of the same name. The series aired for 24
              episodes, from April to September 2011. It is set in 2010 and
              follows Rintaro Okabe, who together with his friends accidentally
              discovers a method of time travel through which they can send text
              messages to the past, thereby changing the present. It is part of
              the Science Adventure franchise along with Chaos;Head and
              Robotics;Notes. The series was directed by Hiroshi Hamasaki and
              Takuya Satō, and written by Jukki Hanada, with animation direction
              and character design by Kyuuta Sakai, and music by Takeshi Abo. It
              was simulcast in North and South America, Africa, the Middle East,
              and parts of Europe by Crunchyroll and the United Kingdom by Anime
              on Demand. A 25th episode was later included with the DVD and
              Blu-ray releases; these releases were handled by Funimation in
              North America and by Manga Entertainment in the United Kingdom.
              Critics praised its character development and its themes of time
              travel, human nature and its perspective on PTSD. It is considered
              one of the best anime series of the 2010s being ranked 3rd on
              Myanimelist. The series has spawned four original net animation
              episodes and a spinoff film. An anime adaptation of Steins;Gate 0,
              the sequel to the original Steins;Gate game, premiered in 2018.

              samurai Gintoki Sakata, who works as a freelancer in his
              self-established store, "Yorozuya", alongside his friends
              Shinpachi Shimura and Kagura, offering a wide range of services to
              handle various tasks and odd jobs. Sorachi added the science
              fiction setting to develop characters to his liking after his
              editor suggested doing a historical series. The series has been
              adapted into an original video animation (OVA) by Sunrise and was

              its first chapters in their Shonen Jump manga anthology. It
              debuted in the January 2007 issue and was serialized at a rate of
              one chapter a month. Sentai Filmworks initially licensed the
              series. The website Crunchyroll purchased the anime's streaming
              rights and home video rights. In Japan, the Gintama manga has been

              the series, as well as its overarching plot and action
              choreography.
